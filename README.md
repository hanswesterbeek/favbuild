# Introduction

This is a sample project demonstrating execution of functional tests.

It uses:

 - [gradle-docker-plugin](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin)
 - [docker-compose-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin)
 
 
Out of scope (but required in reality):
 - Selenium (the test just consumes a json endpoint)
 - a nice jenkins setup taking advantage of gradle parallel execution of iT and fT
